        Full Stack Web Developer leveraging a Physical Therapy background to build intuitive and responsive web experiences for all users. Skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web APIs, Third-Party APIs, Server-Side APIs, Node.js, Object Oriented Programming, Express.js, SQL, NoSQL, Model-View-Controllers, Object-Relational Mapping, Progressive Web Applications, and React were sharpened at the UNCC-Coding Bootcamp, as well as Coursera and Treehouse. Through previous experience as a Physical Therapist over the course of 14 years, I have gained critical thinking skills, the ability to think outside the box, the ability to view problems from different angles, the ability to collaborate and contribute in a team setting, and a passion for learning and staying up-to-date with trends and advancements. Combined with an artistic eye and experience in creating art through Photoshop and with paint and canvas, I develop applications that are equally attractive on the front end and back end.
